# Interviewing Qs

As a new interviewer I figured it would be helpful to collect questions that
I think are useful to ask candidates depending on which stage in the interview
process they are. I'm attempting to organize these questions based on the
candidates experience as well so that candidates don't get any unfair questions.

I tried to outline my philosophy for each category of questions, career fair,
phone screen and onsite.
