# Phone Screen Questions

### These questions are meant to be done in a skype/phone screen interview.
### Generally it's a good idea to have one main question. I'd say a good
### metric would be if the candidate finishes the question then it's a pass.
### If the candidate finishes the question with time, then have a couple extra
### follow up questions and then it's a strong pass.
### If the first question isn't finished or is wrong then it is not a pass.
